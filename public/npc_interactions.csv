Lost and needs directions to the nearest settlement (or a different settlement if already in one).
Recently ran into a large sum of gold and looking to blow it all at the nearest tavern (may or may not invite players along depending on reactions).
Traveling on pilgrimage to a holy site and looks to convert any who listen to them for too long.
"On their way to a pay off a debt with a local lord, but something mundane is impeding their travel (broken wheel, lame horse/mule, muddy road, etc)"
"They've never been outside their home village before and they're gawking at everything they're seeing around them, may request to tag along with the players if they're especially far from any settlements."
"They're low or empty on food and provisions and just need something to eat, they look ragged and malnourished."
"They've been sent on a job to deliver some supplies to a merchant at a local settlement, but their horse is barely able to move the cart and is likely to exhaust itself."
"They ask if you'd be interested in playing them at a well-known game (dice, knucklebones, draughts, drinking, etc). May or may not have bets made on the result, depending on demeanor."
"They have a rather embarrassing wardrobe malfunction that they haven't noticed yet, but stop to ask for a smoke."
"They're reading some sort of official edict or bit of news from a courier and they can't believe the audacity of it, they just have to take your time up by complaining to somebody about it. No amount of polite conversation enders will suffice until they've wasted hours of the player's time."
"They've lost a pet of some kind in the area and they're quite frantic about getting them back, as if they had lost a child."
"They seem rather confused about everything and can't quite place what they're doing there or why they're even talking to the players. Nothing they say seems to make any particular sense. Causes may range from being elderly, drugged, exhausted, just plain mentally unbalanced, or some other reason."
"They've got an item that they're trying to get rid of and the player(s) seem like the sort of folk that may want to trade them for it. Most likely it's a relatively mundane item , but potentially could be something of higher value."
"They're feuding with a significant other and the argument is getting quite loud. The argument doesn't get particularly physical or violent, just many personal details are aired in public to everyone within earshot."
They're taking a break from some sort of job they're performing and looking for any excuse they can to just not work right now and the player(s) seem interesting enough to talk to.
"They've got a piece of clothing or gear that's in some state of disrepair and keeping them from moving on, but they don't have anything to repair it with."
"They seem to be taking notes on some feature of the area around them, an object, an animal or monster, or even the people or players themselves. They're apparently writing these for a book or journal of some kind and they will act distracted regarding anything the players talk to them about."
"They know of a checkpoint that will be encountered coming into a local settlement. They seem particularly concerned about something they have with them and need help getting it through the checkpoint. Depending on the NPC, it may or may not be illegal contraband or just an item that would likely get stolen by the guards at the checkpoint."
"They're on their way back home after a particularly difficult journey, they're worn out and exhausted and not in a good mood to talk with anybody."
They're happy to tag along with the players or have extra room on a cart/wagon for them to hitch a ride to the nearest settlement or farmstead and aren't looking for anything in return apart from some good conversation.
"They're having some sort of disagreement with a traveling companion regarding a basic fact that neither can agree on. Neither seems particularly intelligent enough to understand the subject, but both claim to be experts on the thing."
"They see something that the player(s) are carrying with them and are immediately interested in buying the thing. They're some sort of collector or connoisseur or just a person in desperate need of the thing. Depending on reactions/skill-use, might be persuaded to pay above regular price for it."
"They've been carrying a bundle of small items on their back, but a hole in their sack has been causing some of the things to slowly fall out behind them. They're unaware of what's happening when they meet the player(s)."
"They're looking for some sort of unique feature in the area, it could be a local attraction, a holy site, something potentially supernatural or unexplained, or just a landmark they were supposed to be meeting somebody at."
"They're trying particularly hard to ingratiate themselves with the player(s). It's obvious that they want something from them (money, food, items, help), but won't just come right out and say it."
"They've recently injured themselves. It's not particularly life-threatening, but it's definitely hampering their ability to travel and/or get things done."
"They've been sent somewhere far off to buy something and are looking for any potential alternative they can to save themselves the trip. It's not really urgent, they just don't really want to travel that far for it."
They've been called upon a by a local lord into service with a militia or army or into some kind of group and they're having second thoughts about joining up. They're rather indecisive and they could easily be persuaded either way with a good enough argument.
"They're asking very direct questions about a specific person or thing in the area, trying to get any details they can about where a person or thing is and who was the last person they/it were seen with. Depending on reactions, they may be aggressive in their questioning or just leave it at whatever the players answer with before moving on. They'll do their best to avoid giving away why they're looking for the person or thing."
"They're an apprentice of some kind who was given a job to do by their master, but seemed to have mucked the whole thing up and they're at a loss for what they should do next."
They're fed up with a local authority or official in the area and seem to be looking for anyone they can find in the area who agrees with them to try to do something about it.
"They've caught something quite small and unusual that they're not sure about, they'd like some help on how to handle it as they're not sure if they should just let it go or if it's too dangerous/valuable to be set free."
"They need a courier to deliver an important message to somebody in a settlement far away, but they require the utmost secrecy regarding the message. If ever opened, the message itself that is getting delivered doesn't seem to make any sense and may be in some sort of coded language."
They feel like someone or something has been following them. Stalking them. Can the PCs check it out?
"The NPC is certain that they’ve seen you before, but can’t remember where. Was it on a wanted poster? Was it in the Tavern? Was it on the ship coming over from their homeland? They just can’t put their finger on it…"
"They lost an item. They had it on them yesterday, and they thought they had it with them when they started out this morning, but it’s missing now. Have you seen it?"
"They’re writing a travelogue about this area would like to ask you some questions about what you’ve seen as far as flora and fauna, locals, the surrounding terrain and countryside."
They’re desperate for coin and willing to part with what they say is a valuable family heirloom.
"They just need to travel with someone because “safely in numbers” and they don’t feel safe traveling alone, but you look like you can offer some measure of protection."
"They ask which way is south. They’re supposed to meet someone around here and their not sure if they need to go further, or if they’ve gone too far already."
The NPC approaches the party with a scowl on their face. They accuse one of the PCs of sleeping with their partner. There's a rampant adulterer afoot who looks quite similar to the PC.
A duel is about to unfold and one of the participants is a child. (The child is either helpless or a skilled assassin; DMs choice.)
"It's clear that they're following you and trying to listen in on anything you're saying, either by hiding in bushes or trying to act nonchalant, but they don't seem to be very good at hiding themselves. They will run away if confronted and they'll just say that ""somebody"" paid them a gold coin to do it, but can't give any other details, no matter how much they're questioned."
"They have some sort of bird on their shoulder that talks quietly in their ear, almost as if it is the bird itself that is telling the person what to say. The person asks the player(s) about what they know of any potential uprisings from ""the Rat Guild"" or the ""Council of Cats"". They speak in hushed tones and keep looking at the ground all around them to make sure there are no animals around."
"No matter the difference in age between NPC and the players, they look at the player(s) as if they were new to adventuring and tries to give them professional advice and starts trying to impress them with stories of their own adventures before they settled down."
They notice something out of place or in need of repair that the player(s) are carrying and offer to repair it or know someone who could repair it for a small fee (10% discount on whatever the normal cost would be).
They're on the lookout for a certain person and asking anybody they come across if they've seen them. That person was their former business partner who cheated them out of a good deal of money and/or supplies. They will get violent if and when they find the person.
"They say that they're just out for a walk, which suggests they're home is nearby. If the group is not in a city and they have a favorable reaction or if the players are particularly friendly, they may offer them a drink if they come back to their place. They provide drinks and some conversation, this isn't a trap."
"They're pulling a child by the hand with them, the child seems especially distraught and may also be actively crying. The adult won't say anything to the player(s), but will growl at the child and tell them to ""Shut yer' damn hole!"" and other such things. If confronted, they'll tell the players to ""Mind yer' own damn business!"" It's a parent, just bringing their child with them back home from some mischief."
"They're an older NPC, simply resting by the side, wiping their brow (or shivering in furs if it's cold out). They look exhausted and worn out. A pile of split logs lays behind them, but they hardly seem in any condition to gather it up themselves, not at the moment at least."
"They're looking for a particular animal or monster to watch. They're not hunting it to catch or kill, they just like watching that kind of animal/monster and take notes on all the different ones they've seen before. Potentially may have some useful notes on lore or behavior or physical differences among creatures of that species. They're a hobbyist who just likes seeing the thing out in the wild."
"They seem to be traveling with something particularly disgusting, not dangerous or very valuable, just a pile of something gross and unpleasant. They won't comment on the thing and will try to just change the subject if it's brought up. They will get offended if pressed on it and just try to leave without any explanation."
"They're carrying a map and shovel with them that they say they bought some ways back from a treasure hunter. They'll be defensive and guarded if they suspect the player(s) are trying to get their treasure. If the player(s) are persuasive or agree not to take any of the treasure, they'll continue the search with them. The spot marked 'X' is close by. On low odds (roll of 1), they'll actually find something quite valuable. Otherwise they'll either dig an empty hole and find nothing or will find something of questionable value, possibly it's just junk that was freshly buried. If it's the latter, the NPC will start running in the direction they said they bought the map from."
"They appear to be playing a sport of some sort involving a ball and a stick or mallet. The rules aren't immediately apparent. On a negative reaction, they'll blame you for any bad shots that are made, on a good reaction they'll ask about playing through or may even ask the player(s) to join in. Bets may or may not be made on the results."
They're looking for love in all the wrong places and have become attracted to somebody or some thing that will cause a lot of problems for them. They're truly blinded by love.
"They're not very proficient in the local language, and looking for somebody who can help them get through a transaction."
"They're fascinated by new stories and faraway places, and the PCs' appearance suggests they have good stories to tell."
They're being harassed (sexually or otherwise) by a third party and hope that hanging around imposing people will dissuade the harasser.
"They're pursuing a religious duty to do a good deed (daily, as penance for a sin, or whatever) and want to know if they can help the PCs with anything."
They've been robbed and are searching for anybody who has seen anything. There may be an edge of suspicion that the PCs might be the thieves.
"There's a spot right above the small of their back that desperately needs itching, and they can't reach it."
"They need to exchange large or foreign coins, or non-coin treasure, for more readily usable coins."
"They're hamhandedly attempting some task that one of the PCs is expert at; if the PC is empathic at all, they will be very tempted to offer help."
They've cooked too much food and are looking for somebody to help eat it.
"They appear to be a professional in their field and put on the airs of somebody who knows alot about what they do, but if the players engage in any sort of in-depth conversation with them, they'll likely discover that this person has no idea what they're actually talking about. If confronted about it, they'll admit that they don't actually know anything about it, they're just trying to make ends meet and plead with the player(s) to not expose them."
"A pair of NPCs are taking turns making shots at a target, neither seems to be particularly good at shooting, but they brag and boast no matter how bad their shots are. Depending on their reactions to the player(s), they may challenge the player(s) to a round of target shooting. Potentially they're running a con."
"No matter what time of day it is, they are staggering down the path towards you, obviously drunk and shouting ridiculous things at anybody they see or who passes by. If the player(s) don't watch their step around the NPC(s), one of the drunks will almost trip and fall into them, then begin vomiting all over the player(s) shoes."
"They're standing around next to what looks like a small wreath of flowers, it almost looks like a memorial of some sort to mark a spot where something must have happened. They're sweeping the space with a broom and are apparently talking to themselves. They pay no mind to the player(s) unless talked to, even then, it will take them a minute to hear the player."
"They are a pitiful sight with their tin cup in hand. Shambling down the road on one leg and a crutch, one of their eyes covered with a bandage and their hair stringy and unwashed. The smell that emanates from them is horrible and makes you want to gag. They stop in front of you, not saying anything, just holding out the cup, shaking it ever so slightly."
"They're standing as still as a rock, in a resting or active position, just looking forward at nothing in particular. They don't seem to be registering any sights or sounds. However, if they're touched in any way, they will snap out of whatever it was that had frozen them and will continue on as if nothing had happened. There's no way to really tell how long they had been like that."
"They have a big smile on their lips, and a dribble of spit coming from the side of their mouth. Trying to talk to them seems an effort in futility, as they only smile back and nod their head, but there doesn't seem to be any sense of understanding from them."
Two NPCs are arguing about what is in the third verse of a popular song. They want the PCs to resolve the argument for them.
A middle-aged person seizes on the notion that one of the PCs would make a good marriage partner for their daughter. It turns out that they're trying to outrun their daughter's own hopes for a marriage that they consider unsuitable.
"Some NPCs wish to hold a religious ceremony which, by ancient custom, requires at least one more participant."
"A landowner is frustrated with crop failures and is looking for a better place to move to. They want information about soil, rainfall, insects, and so forth in the places that the PCs have traveled through."
A tavern keeper has been dealing with a group of aggressive rowdies who have been monopolizing their establishment and driving other customers away. They offer free refreshments if the PCs can drive off the rowdies.
A small group is raising a barn or some other building and is short of muscle to accomplish it. They promise a delicious feast afterward.
"A person's son is being wooed by an allegedly heroic veteran of the wars. The man is suspicious and wants someone to prove or disprove her claims, especially in a way that convinces the son."
"They have been called upon to perform a duty by a person in authority, and are honor-bound to carrying it out, however, they don't seem to be in any physical condition to actually carry out the duty itself."
"They have become disillusioned with a local religious leader and are preaching to anyone that will listen that that religion is full of lies and blasphemies, that the truly chosen people need to rise up against the false believers."
"They seem to be maintaining this local area, protecting it from harm in whatever small ways they can, either cleaning up or repairing or just generally keeping things in good order around. They may see any attempt to camp out in the area as a defilement unless precautions or they are appeased in some way."
They were part of a refugee group that got separated and they're desperately searching for their spouse and children. They're frantically asking if anybody has seen them and they seem on the verge of tears.
"They're walking towards you barely clothed, a desperate look in their face. Apparently bandits have stolen everything from them, including the clothes off their back. They point off in the direction they came from and where, presumably, the bandits might still be found if you hurried."
"The NPC stops their wagon near the party and starts yelling: ""The baby's coming!"" over and over. There is a woman who is pregnant and the baby is about to come out."
"The NPC stops their wagon near the party and starts yelling: ""The baby's coming!"" over and over. There is a cow in the back of the wagon who is pregnant and the calf is about to come out."
"A flock of birds takes flight from a nearby bush shortly followed by an arrow that embeds itself in the ground near a party member. The archer can be seen standing a few dozen feet behind the bush in the shadows under a tree. A) If the party talks to the archer, they find a pre-teen child who was trying to shoot the birds and missed. The father shows up shortly and explains this is the child's first hunting trip. B) If the party kills the archer, the archer's father will show up and explain through his tears that this was the child's first hunting trip and the child was inexperienced with a bow. The grief stricken father will tell the locals how the party committed manslaughter on his child and all interactions in the local area will have a negative response."
"There's a wedding ceremony going on, how big or small depends on how many NPCs are there. The man looks happy at everything happening, but the bride seems less than enthused or is possibly even crying about the whole thing. Chances are this was an arranged marriage."
"They stop the party from moving on here and insist that this spot of land here is their property and they won't be having trespassers. They say that the party will need to go around if they want to get wherever they're going, which based on what they're saying is ""their land"" will likely cost the party travel time."
"An older person is pulling along a young child by a chain that is attached around their neck. The child isn't crying, but they're certainly not enjoying the treatment, yet they don't make any eye contact with the party or make any plea for help."
"They're dressed quite provocatively and, regardless of gender, they ask if you'd, ""like to have a go at it? If you got the coin, I got the time."" and give you a knowing glance."
"They're part of an odd couple, both from two different races, but definitely in an intimate relationship. There's another individual or group nearby who has a problem with this and is insulting them, possibly even getting physical with at least one of the pair, finding the relationship to be disgusting. It might not already be violent, but it's about to get that way."
"You hear moans, cries, and gasps coming from behind some cover, either behind some bushes or behind a window or some other location just outside of view. It sounds as though somebody is getting their insides torn out. Investigating the scene reveals that it is actually a couple getting intimate. They're incredibly surprised at being walked in on."
"They're off on the side of the road, standing over a big cooking pot, stirring up a meal. They ask if you'd want to join them for a meal. Nothing bad happens, it's just a meal, lighten up."
"They're part of a group standing around, they're singing or chanting some sort of song. As you stop to listen, you realize you can't understand any of the words, though they're oddly familiar, but just barely outside of your comprehension. As you listen longer, you find yourself getting mesmerized by the song."
"They're trying to speak to you in an incomprehensible language, they're gesturing wildly at something ""over there"", but beyond that you have no idea what they're trying to tell you about. They seem quite insistent."
"They're apparently passed out drunk, lying on the floor with an empty bottle still clutched in their hand. They don't appear to be in any immediate danger or anything and likely they'll wake up in a few hours, but close by sits a small bag, filled with gold coins, it looks like quite a bit of money. Nobody else seems to be around that would witness anything happening."
"They are pacing around, looking up at the sky, they seem to be quite impatient about something, they're muttering something about, ""He was supposed to have been here by now, what's keeping him?"". If asked about who they're waiting for, they simply reply, ""Well I'm waiting for HIM obviously, who else would I be waiting for?"", but won't provide any elaboration as to who ""HIM"" is. If the players wait around with the character, nobody will show up, no matter how long they wait for, though at some point, after a few hours, the person(s) who were waiting will mysteriously have disappeared."
"They're sitting off the beaten path, having a picnic of sorts, however, they don't speak any language you can recognize. They will only look at you coldly if you attempt to speak with them. If there is more than one in the group, they will say some things to each other while looking at you, but won't engage in any dialogue with you, though you suspect they can understand everything you're saying."
"They're engaged in singing a song and possibly even playing some instruments. It's actually a good song, though you don't quite recognize it. If you stay to pass the time, they'll play a number of different tunes, some may even drop some historical lore."
"They have a fantastic business opportunity that they'd love to talk with you about, if you just have a few moments to spare! This is like nothing else you've ever heard of and you'll be kicking yourself if you let an opportunity like this pass you by! This is what you would call an upward mobility business arrangement, for a small fee every month, you can recruit others into your small business, who then pay you a recruitment fee every month, everybody wins!"

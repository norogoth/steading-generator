"""and that's the second time I got crabs."""
"""And I said to him, that's no displacer beast, that's my wife!"""
"""That's not beer they're drinking."""
"""...so I told myself, Mario, take it easy!"""
"""No Jane I'm not going to your stupid baby's baptism to Tiamat"""

"""So I says to her, that's BARLEY legal!"""
"""So there I was, I had 1 foot on the latrine, I had 2 pieces of pie left, the dog was having a seizure."""
"“So I’m sitting there, covered in grog and the tentacles can’t even touch me...”"
“... it was THIS big! And that was just between the eyes!”
“You really think she’s into it...?”
"""...so my fist got the sucker in his liver and that little weasel went scurryin'! But enough about your husband, how are you doing?"""
"""No, no, no, the pigeon is the least of your problems.."""
"""Oh god, its the goose. run."""
"""Hey, who moved my cheese?"""
"“Just hire some band of adventurers to do it, they will accept anything as long as you tell them it’s a quest.”"

"""These owl tassels cost HOW much?"""
"""You know, it's about time they put a Tavern in that Orphanage."""
“Some holy woman - she’s slept with half the nuns!!!”
"""I'm going to the bear pits tomorrow. Wanna come with?"""
“And they were roommates...”
"""...and that's how I got trampled over by a herd of owlbears"""
"""THAT'S the reason you keep honey on you?! For that!?"""
"""...that's how they convinced me that I needed a pet crow."""
"""So I was on my third pint at that point..."""
"""I don't know Marv, I work my ass off to provide for her and what do I get? My own boot leather fried in a skillet and served with a side of spit."""
"""Now why the hell wouldja do that?!"""
"""...thinks 4 swords are too many? That's ridiculous..."""
"""I'd ask for medium-rare but everyone knows what they make this steak out of is better burnt."""
“But I DID see it! He ate the whole bag of nails!”
"“The cleric said it should clear up if I keep putting the poultice on it. Smells like piss, it does”"

"""She ate how many breadsticks?"""
"""No Dad I'm not a crazed marauder, I'm an adventurer. Well, the difference being, one's a job and the other's mental sickness."""
"""...and I said unicorns don't even wear pants."""
"""Where did you find a blue antler at 3 in the morning?"""
“Had a dog once. Turns out it was just a creepy old Druid.”
"""And that's how I learned that flammable and inflammable mean the same thing... and it's also why I can't grow eyebrows."""

"""No, no! It's true! At least that's what I was told... Drink a troll's blood at midnight and you'll get younger right on the spot!"""
"""I swear to the gods that boy's got some ogre in him. I saw him eat fifty eggs in an hour."""

“...was a good friend of mine. Never understood a word he said but I helped him drink his wine..”
"""... and they didn't know what to feed the damn thing, so they figured to just feed it nails and call it a day. By the way, you wouldn't happen to know someone in need of a dead ostrich, would you?"""
“.... and that is why you don’t eat the blue ones. “

"“Lucky for us, the wizard lit the pinecones on fire, and we hurled them at the dire wolves that had chased us up the trees!”"
“Can we not talk about that incident in the graveyard?”
“You did what with a fire elemental?”
"""And so I told him, “Mate, you’re just a post-birth abortion waiting to happen.” Shit really hit the cyclone after that."""
"""Nobody talk about those damn chickens okay?"""
"""... and, of course, the invisibility spell had to pick that specific moment to wear off, and me without even a towel to cover myself with. And that's the story of how I ended up getting my head and ass kicked in by the women's rugby team."""

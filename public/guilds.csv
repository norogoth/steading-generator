They recruit all types, but their primary composition is of the more physically inclined. Everyone has to pull their weight on a ship."
"Disciples of Trastor: Almost more of a cult than a guild, the Disciples of Trastor follow the teachings of an ancient necromancer, rumored to have been the first Lich. Their practices are, of course, veiled in secrecy, as Necromancy is generally frowned upon, but every tavern usually has one drunk who claims to know all about their secret rituals…. heard from a completely reliable and not at all suspect chain of sources."

"The Sons of the Sword: A guild of knights dedicated to mastery of swordplay. They take mostly noble sons, but those with enough of a reputation may be able to secure membership.

"Purple Pansies: One of the longest-standing guilds, the Pansies are well respected and quite proud of their heritage, which is very serious and not all silly. The tale seems slightly different every time it is told, however. The Pansies are almost always seen in their ostentatious formal uniform, gratuitously bedecked in brightly colored ribbons and polished medals. (Seriously, though, the founder did participate extensively in a resistance against an occupying army. It just wasn’t very well documented.)"

Dedicated to the freedom and clarity of the skies, Flying Dragoon’s have no problems speaking their mind, and many are quite vocal about being committed to fighting tyranny if the need ever again arose.

"Golden Griffin Guild: Once a big and prosperous guild spanning their work through many nations, supporting and training many adventurers, they had their castle destroyed by plague magic and now ,the few members left, live in a dilapidated tavern in a rural town. The Guildmaster, Svetlana Trigg, a middle Aged Wood Elf, still receives requests from the local populace, but unable to fill them will pass the quests to any of the tavern’s patrons who are interested in some easy cash. People close to her also say that she has maps of local abandoned dungeons and fortresses, including one of the old Golden Griffin Castle, now plagued with blight, surrounded by poisonous bogs and home to all kind of evil and pestilence, but still, filled with the treasures of adventurers who wintered there."
"The Lightning Hooves: Guild of all types of transporters, riders, and drivers of all kinds.

"The Heirs of Xor-Kumbukquan: This guild is a trail of refugees who survived a subterran battle around the already perilously conflicted dwarf city Xor-Kumbukquan in which the drow defeated the dwarf army that stood watch. This specific guild of dwarfs dared venture to the surface world in order to plan the recapture of their home city. They are, for dwarf standards, open to new things and even allowed other races to join their guild, which they originally registered to have weight in surfacer politics. Now some dwarfs catch themselves thinking about dwelling on the surface forever. The dwarfes are apparently about to split up into different groups again, re-creating the fate of Xor-Kumbukquan. Some disagree with letting other races join, some want to become mountain dwarves and get even higher into the mountains. They are expert miners and sell coal and small amounts of valuable materials found under the earth.

"The NPC’s: A guild of meta-knowledge truthers who recognize that there is something off in the world. For example, why does everybody always stand 5 feet apart from one another?"

"The Royal Bird Watching Society: if you are dreaming of sitting alongside tranquil rivers watching the graceful dance of migrating birds then this is not the guild for you, as only the most diehard and adventurous birdwatchers choose to join the RBWS. Perhaps one of the most ruthless and blood thirsty guilds in the land, the RBWS’s annual bird watching competation see’s adventurous birdwatchers competing to find some of the most far flung, exotic and dangerous birds in the world.

"Scroungers: A group of people looking to teach the homeless, poor, or whomever is curious how to find food wherever they go: which spotted mushrooms are good to eat, and which will cause your skin to rot. How long can a banana sit in the trash before it’s considered inedible? Which roots should be boiled, which should be ground, and which should be left out to dry to attract green beetles: which make for a great paste on old toast. Great for aspiring adventurers, those who find it difficult to make or keep coin, and those who are thrifty and curious!"

"The Old Constabulary: When a new lord moves in, sometimes he wants to put new laws in place. Guardsmen/Police that refuse to go against their long standing principles for trivial things such as a temporary new boss, will generally be unceremoniously dropped from the force. That’s where the Old Constabulary recruit from. Their motives are to uphold the (previously established) law, and provide safety to those harassed for jumped up charges.

"The Slave Traders Union: They would never trade slaves in an area where it is forbidden but this merchants guild will do anything and everything within the law to make as much money as possible. There is even a special division of lawyers dedicated to finding loopholes for lucretive streams of business. There are certain benefits to being a member so long as your fees are up to date such as if a member is accused of something illegal the guild will pay for their defense attorney.

Their leader is a halfling with a silver tongue who has skin in the game in every game, and a pension for getting other people in trouble instead of themselves."

These folk seek adventure and wish it upon others, however they see the difficult level of entry and so they vow to keep the paths walked so that fledgling hikers, travellers, merchants, and adventurers can go forth without fear and with some level of decency. Many are retired folk, and many are simply folk who care about their health. “Walk the path, my friends, so that others may follow.” Edit: some are map makers and contribute by prospecting new paths. Each year they hold a ceremony to announce the formation of a single new path. Each member walks on it. In doing so a brand new path is born. The guild values distance efficiency, terrain quality, scenic score, oxygen level based on elevation, and many other factors. Note that they value the origin and the destination less because they believe it is the journey that matters most."
"The Silent Orchestra: A surprisingly large guild consisting of bards and some rogues. They are used to pass along messages to others, sometimes in secret, sometimes in public.

This guild welcomes all outcasts but especially warforged and other homonculi or those of mongrel blood – tieflings are a large minority, and many of the members of the guild are sorcerers. They make their gold through typical mercenary work, but lend sorcerous aid to researchers and those who wish to study artificial life forms. Wise investment of wealth allows them to intercede on the behalf of artificial beings and mongrels everywhere who are mistreated. Their symbol is a brown field divided by black bands, a heart at its center – the heart is half flesh, half metal."
"The Order of Militant Moderates: This cabal of ascetics firmly believe that mankind is unworthy of excessive reputation. They wear rough-spun robes of undyed wool and plain wooden masks to obscure their features. Each chapter meets once a month to nominate individuals operating within their jurisdiction who have gained too much acclaim. A vote is held and one target is selected. It is then each member’s duty to bring about disgrace and humiliation to that individual, by covert means. Additional Details: The Order employs methods of maintaining anonymity even during internal proceedings. This allows them to enact and discuss elaborate plots of humiliation against vainglorious citizens without accruing any renown even within their own circles. Larger chapters might nominate more than one target, but once nominated the target is never removed from the chapter’s bounty board until they have been suitably humiliated. Particularly prominent targets have, at times, been added to the list on a ‘for life’ basis. They refer to one another as ‘Moderator’ and believe they perform vital work to keep mankind’s ego in check. Outsiders often refer to them by the epithet ‘Peggers’, since they are said to be gripped by jealousy and obsessed with taking their betters down a peg. Any member inflicting more than superficial bodily harm against a target is subject to expulsion from the Order: Bruises and scrapes are acceptable, broken bones and cuts are not."
"Victus Mercentile Guild: A merchant’s guild renound for their prowess and aggressive acquisition behavior. Originally tasked with keeping trade routes safe, they have since begun acquiring all shops, banks, and caravans, and enforcing various ‘Maintenance fees’ on its members, while gray robed bureaucrats have become the norm in most cities."
